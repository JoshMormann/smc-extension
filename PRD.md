# SMC Extension - Product Requirements Document (Updated)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Product Overview**

The SMC (SREF Manager Collection) Extension is a Chrome extension that enhances the Midjourney web application experience by allowing users to quickly save discovered SREF codes to their personal SMC Manager account. The extension provides seamless integration between Midjourney and the SMC Manager web application through intelligent viewport-based SREF detection and one-click saving functionality.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Value Proposition**

- **Speed**: Save SREF codes directly from Midjourney without switching applications
- **Visual Feedback**: Instantly see which SREF codes are already saved vs. available to save
- **Seamless Integration**: Works within the existing Midjourney web interface with infinite scroll optimization
- **Minimal Friction**: Simple naming process for quick saves
- **Performance**: Smooth scrolling experience with intelligent viewport-based processing

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Architecture**

### **Target Platform**
- **Primary**: Midjourney web application (not Discord)
- **Authentication**: Supabase session detection from SMC Manager web app
- **Data Storage**: Direct to Supabase when authenticated
- **Performance**: Viewport-based scanning optimized for infinite scroll

### **Extension Behavior**
- **When Not Authenticated**: Silent operation (no popups, no errors)
- **When Authenticated**: Full functionality with visual indicators
- **Scroll Optimization**: Loading indicators during scroll, processing on pause

## ðŸ“‹ **Core Functionality**

### **1. SREF Detection & Analysis**
- **Method**: Viewport-based DOM scanning for SREF code patterns
- **Frequency**: On page load, scroll events (debounced), and dynamic content changes
- **Scope**: Scan only visible content in viewport with intelligent scroll handling
- **Performance Optimization**: 
  - Show loading indicators (spinners) during active scrolling
  - Process SREF detection when user pauses scrolling (debounced, 500ms)
  - Lazy load indicators as content comes into view
  - Cache processed SREF codes to avoid re-scanning
  - Use Intersection Observer API for efficient viewport detection

### **2. Visual Status Indicators**
- **Known SREF Codes**: Display green check icon (âœ“) inside SREF span tags
- **Unknown SREF Codes**: Display SMC logo (16x16px) inside SREF span tags
- **Loading State**: Show spinner icon during processing
- **Placement**: Inline within existing SREF code elements
- **Progressive Loading**: Indicators appear as content becomes visible

### **3. Save Functionality**
- **Trigger**: Click on SMC logo next to unknown SREF code
- **UI**: Tooltip-style input field with "Name this SREF" placeholder
- **Submission**: Enter key or submit button
- **Process**: 
  1. Upload all images from that SREF output instance
  2. Associate images with the SREF code and user-provided name
  3. Save to user's SMC Manager account
  4. Update all instances of that SREF code to show green check
- **Loading State**: Show save progress indicator during upload

### **4. Session Management**
- **Detection**: Check for existing Supabase session from SMC Manager web app
- **Silent Mode**: If no session, extension operates silently without errors
- **Documentation**: User guidance provided on main SMC Manager website

## ðŸŽ¨ **User Experience Flow**

### **Authenticated User Flow**
1. User browses Midjourney web app (infinite scroll)
2. Extension scans visible content for SREF codes
3. During scrolling: Loading spinners appear for new content
4. When scrolling pauses: Visual indicators appear:
   - Green checks for already-saved SREF codes
   - SMC logos for unsaved SREF codes
5. User clicks SMC logo on desired SREF code
6. Input tooltip appears with "Name this SREF" placeholder
7. User enters name and presses Enter
8. Save progress indicator shows during upload
9. Images upload and SREF saves to account
10. All instances of that SREF code update to green check
11. User continues scrolling with smooth performance

### **Unauthenticated User Flow**
1. User browses Midjourney web app
2. Extension operates silently (no visual indicators or processing)
3. No errors or popups displayed
4. User can use Midjourney normally with full performance
5. Documentation on SMC Manager website explains authentication requirement

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Requirements**

### **Content Scripts**
- **Target**: Midjourney web application
- **Permissions**: DOM access, storage access
- **Injection**: Automatic on Midjourney pages
- **Performance**: Viewport-based scanning with scroll optimization

### **Background Script**
- **Purpose**: Session management, Supabase communication
- **Storage**: Chrome extension storage for session state
- **Caching**: Cache processed SREF codes and user's saved codes

### **Popup Interface**
- **Purpose**: Extension settings and status (minimal)
- **Content**: Authentication status, basic info

### **Data Flow**
1. **Viewport Detection**: Content script monitors visible content using Intersection Observer
2. **Scroll Handling**: Debounced scroll events trigger processing
3. **Authentication**: Background script checks Supabase session
4. **Comparison**: Query user's saved SREF codes from Supabase (cached)
5. **Visual Update**: Content script updates DOM with indicators progressively
6. **Save Process**: Background script handles image upload and data saving

## ðŸ“Š **Data Models**

### **SREF Code Detection**
```typescript
interface DetectedSREF {
  code: string;
  element: HTMLElement;
  images: string[];
  isKnown: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
  isProcessed: boolean;
  isVisible: boolean;
}
```

### **Viewport Scanner State**
```typescript
interface ScannerState {
  processedElements: Set<HTMLElement>;
  scrollDebounceTimer: number;
  userSavedCodes: Set<string>;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  isProcessing: boolean;
}
```

### **Save Request**
```typescript
interface SaveSREFRequest {
  code: string;
  name: string;
  images: string[];
  userId: string;
}
```

    this.showLoadingIndicators();
    
    // Debounce actual processing
    this.scrollDebounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {
      this.processVisibleContent();
    }, 500);

    // Process only unprocessed elements in viewport
    // Cache results to avoid re-processing
